# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model
This is a school project for year 11 computer class.\n
Now, I don't really know how to write a readme.md, so this is what we got.\n
Choose one or several of your favorite cryptocurrencies.  Develop a couple of mathematical models in python which attempt to predict the future and guess the prices of these cryptocurrency.  After your models have been developed, run your program every day for up to one week.  Collect data in regards to how close each model was to correctly predicting the cryptocurrency price.  Write a report discussing the pros and cons of your models.  Discuss which model performed the best.
